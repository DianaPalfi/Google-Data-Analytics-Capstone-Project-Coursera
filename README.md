# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project-Coursera

Course: [Google Data Analytics Professional Certifcate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)

**Introduction**

In this case study, I will perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders by performing real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. To answer business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

**Background**

Cyclystic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

```
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS total_rides,
       COUNT (DISTINCT ride_id) AS total_unique_rides
FROM `capstoneproject.trip_combined_data`;
